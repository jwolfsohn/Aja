# Changes Made to Use Source Code Photos

## What Changed

The website now loads photos from your source code instead of allowing user uploads from the frontend.

### Key Changes:

1. **Removed Frontend Upload Functionality**

   - Removed the upload button from the UI
   - Removed localStorage photo storage
   - Removed the ability for users to delete photos from the website

2. **Added Source Code Photo Management**

   - Created `src/config/photos.js` - Add your photos here!
   - Created `public/photos/` folder - Place your image files here
   - Photos are now loaded from the configuration file
   - Photos are stored as static files, not in browser storage

3. **Updated Components**
   - `src/App.jsx` - Now loads photos from config file
   - `src/components/PhotoGallery.jsx` - Updated to display photos from URLs
   - Removed delete functionality from the gallery
   - Overlay now shows "Click to view" instead of delete button

## How to Add Photos

1. **Add your image files** to `public/photos/` folder

   - Example: `public/photos/birthday-cake.jpg`

2. **Update the config file** `src/config/photos.js`:

   ```javascript
   export const photos = [
     "/photos/birthday-cake.jpg",
     "/photos/photo2.jpg",
     "/photos/photo3.jpg",
   ];
   ```

3. **That's it!** Your photos will appear on the website.

## Files Created

- `src/config/photos.js` - Photo configuration file
- `src/config/photos.example.js` - Example configuration
- `public/photos/` - Folder for your photo files
- `HOW_TO_ADD_PHOTOS.md` - Detailed instructions

## Files Modified

- `src/App.jsx` - Removed localStorage, added config import
- `src/components/PhotoGallery.jsx` - Updated to use URLs, removed delete
- `src/components/PhotoGallery.css` - Updated overlay styling
- `README.md` - Updated documentation
- `vite.config.js` - Configured for public directory

## Next Steps

1. Add your photos to `public/photos/` folder
2. Edit `src/config/photos.js` to list your photos
3. Run `npm run dev` to see your photos
4. Run `npm run deploy` to deploy with photos included

Your dev server should auto-reload and show your photos immediately!
